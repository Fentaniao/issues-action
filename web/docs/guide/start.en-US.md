<Alert type="success">
You can click <Badge>set up a workflow yourself</Badge> to add a custom action, or you can apply a new action based on a template. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/actions-cool/.github">Templates</a>.
</Alert>

### 2. Edit Action

Actions storage address is fixed, unified as `/.github/workflows/xx.yml`.

Let's take the example of the home page and explain it in detail. The corresponding scenario is: when an issue adds the `help wanted` tag, the system will automatically comment.

```yml
name: Issue Reply

on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]

jobs:
  reply-helper:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: help wanted
        if: github.event.label.name == 'help wanted'
        uses: actions-cool/issues-helper@v3
        with:
          actions: 'create-comment'
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          issue-number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
          body: |
            Hello @${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}. We totally like your proposal/feedback, welcome PR„ÄÇ
