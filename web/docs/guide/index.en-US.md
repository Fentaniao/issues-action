## Introduction

The Issues Helper is a GitHub Action that easily helps you automatically manage issues.

### What are GitHub Actions?

Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions. You can discover, create, and share actions to perform any job you'd like, including CI/CD, and combine actions in a completely customized workflow. [More](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions).

`issues-helper` is based on this, using GitHub Actions to help you deal with various operations on issues.
